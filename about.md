I'm Florian and I grew up in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After my B.Sc. in Computer Networking, I started doing software development in Munich. In the time following, I did a M.Eng. in Software Engineering next to my job. This had also been when I started my own little company, with which I did e.g. build up the whole IT-infrastructure of a Start Up with currently 35 employees. If I need to sum up my professional background in three expressions, it would be **AWS Enthusiast, Software Lover, Process Coach**.
