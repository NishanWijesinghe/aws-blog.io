title: Increase AWS-Work Ratio
---

In order to increase my ratio of AWS-related work, I started with a three-points plan. In this blog-post, I want to explain to you, what those are and why I'm taking those steps.

## Point 1: Increase Certification Level

The more you're certified, the easier you can prove your technical track of record and abilities. I'm currently preparing for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional certificate, for which I scheduled a certificate date in mid-November.

My perparation is currently split in two parts. One is getting practical training and reading all lot of [AWS Whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers){:target="_blank"}. The second part is a three days training from the US-based company [ExitCertified](https://www.exitcertified.com){:target="_blank"} on [Advanced Architecting on AWS](https://www.exitcertified.com/training/aws/architect/architecting-advanced-26174-detail.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Point 2: Start Teaching on Cloud Computing / AWS

Getting good and practical training is a highly important part of professional progression. As I did receive that kind of training, I do want to share my knowledge with our people, too. Therefore, I started a position as a private lecturer at [Nuremberg Institute of Technology](http://www.th-nuernberg.eu/){:target="_blank"} for a Master of Engineering in Software Engineering. The topic of the lecture is *Scalable Web-Applications in the Cloud*. Unfortunately, the lecture material is only available in German for now. After the translation from German to English, I'll make the content publicly available on this blog.

## Point 3: Getting Listed at Toptal

When working in an environment with highly skilled people, you're increasing the speed of learning. This means that you're learing-curve is going to get steeper. For that reason, I chose to look for freelancing work at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com){:target="_blank"}. On the first look [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com){:target="_blank"} might just look like any other freelancing portal. However, they do real freelancer pre-screening and only take the top 3% of applicants. By this they can ensure that the listed freelancer are top-notch experts. This means also that you're going to work together with high-class customers and teams, which on the other hand will increase your learning speed on any new topic. In case you're also looking into working as a full-time / part-time freelancer, I highly would recommend an application at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com){:target="_blank"}.
